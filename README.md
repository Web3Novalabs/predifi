# PrediFi - Decentralized outcome prediction protocol (on-chain prediction platform )

Telegram Community: [here](https://t.me/predifi_onchain_build/1)
## Project Overview:
PrediFi is a decentralized prediction protocol built on StarkNet. In a trustless, transparent, and secure environment, it allows users to predict future outcomes across various fields, including sports, finance, and global events. By utilizing starknet technology, PrediFi ensures that all predictions and their results are verifiable onchain and immutable, thus eliminating the need for intermediaries.

PrediFi is a groundbreaking decentralized platform designed to empower individuals, influencers, and communities to enter the dynamic world of prediction markets. Leveraging the transformative power of blockchain technology, PrediFi allows anyone to establish custom prediction markets focused on any event imaginable. This innovative approach provides a lively, engaging, and rewarding way to foster interaction within your community while monetizing the buzz and excitement surrounding trending topics.

In our fast-paced digital age, conversations about predictions are captivating; they span a wide range of subjects, from sports matchups and political elections to the latest pop culture phenomena. Imagine if you could transform those engaging discussions into tangible rewards! With PrediFi, you have the opportunity to create markets where individuals can wager on the outcomes of these events, turning their insights and forecasts into real-world returns.

PrediFi makes it easy to create prediction pools for a wide range of cultural and local events. You can set up pools for major sports championships and awards shows, but that's just the beginning. It's also perfect for engaging with the latest viral trends, community events, environmental happenings, and anything else that sparks buzz in your area. Whether itâ€™s predicting the outcome of a local music festival or the next viral sensation.

## Contract Structure

The PrediFi protocol is modular and organized for clarity, security, and extensibility. Below is an overview of the main contract files and their purposes:

- `src/predifi.cairo`: Main contract logic, including pool management, staking, validation, and dispute resolution.
- `src/interfaces/IERC20.cairo`: ERC20 token interface for STRK and other tokens.
- `src/interfaces/ipredifi.cairo`: Main protocol interface, including pool management, dispute, and validator traits.
- `src/interfaces/iUtils.cairo`: Utility interface (e.g., for price feeds).
- `src/base/types.cairo`: Enums and structs for pools, statuses, categories, odds, stakes, and validators.
- `src/base/events.cairo`: All protocol events (e.g., BetPlaced, UserStaked, PoolResolved).
- `src/base/errors.cairo`: Centralized error messages and codes for all protocol operations.

## Developer Documentation & NatSpec

All public and external functions, types, and events are documented using Cairo NatSpec comments for auditability and developer clarity.

**Example:**
```cairo
/// @notice Places a bet on a pool.
/// @dev Transfers tokens from user, updates odds, and emits BetPlaced event.
/// @param pool_id The pool ID.
/// @param option The option to bet on.
/// @param amount The amount to bet.
fn vote(ref self: ContractState, pool_id: u256, option: felt252, amount: u256) { ... }
```

**Guidelines:**
- Use `@notice` for a summary of the function/type/event.
- Use `@dev` for developer/auditor notes.
- Use `@param` and `@return` for all parameters and return values.
- All new public/external functions must include NatSpec comments.


## Development:

Requirements:
- Rust
- Cairo
- Starknet foundry
- Node

  ``` bash
  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.starkup.dev | sh
  ```
  
  // Method 2:
  
  Install asdf and install scarb, and starknet foundry: https://foundry-rs.github.io/starknet-foundry/getting-started/installation.html

4. Add development tools
  ``` bash
  asdf set --home scarb 2.9.2
  
  asdf set --home starknet-foundry 0.36.0
  
  ```
   
5. Ensure installed properly

 ``` bash
 snforge --version

 scarb --version
 ```

6. Build
``` bash
scarb build
```
